React 19 added new capabilities with a lot of focus on form handling and React Server Components (RSC). In this workshop we will explore the new APIs, discuss the benefits and highlight the potential pitfalls to give you a head start for using these new features in your applications.

In order to get a deep understanding of these new APIs we will explore the following topics:

- React Server Components introduction including how client/server boundaries behave

- React Server Components pitfalls (e.g. data leaks, initial render)

- New & newish hooks: use(Promise|Context), useActionState, useFormStatus, useOptimistic, useTransition, useDeferredValue

- Getting the most out of React leveraging Suspense

The workshop is split into several modules. Each of them starts with a 20 min presentation, 30-50 min coding session and is followed by a 10 min retrospective. The last session will be reserved for topics you might be interested in.

Prerequisites: This workshop is targeted for intermediate and experienced React developers. You should be comfortable using Hooks (incl. useEffect, useRef) and ideally a basic understanding of [Concurrent React](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18#what-is-concurrent-react) is recommended but not required.

Preparation: Please have Node 20+ and pnpm installed on your machine.
