## Exercise 1

Load the product from the database using a server component in `page.tsx`. You can get the data from `../db/getProducts`. Render all products in a list using the `ProductDetail` component.

Note: Don't forget if you use `await` you component function must be async.

## Exercise 2

Pass the promise from `getProducts` to a client component. Use Suspense to first render a fallback "Loading products â€¦" while the products are loaded.

Note: Leverage the `use` hook in the `Products` component.
